### Usage

The official definitions are given in the examples. They should be referred to with their canonical URLs. Copies of all definitions should exist on a KIOLA instance. Missing definitions cannot be referred to in plan definitions.

### Custom Definitions

Custom definitions might be used to specify a different behavior (e.g. define other participants).
